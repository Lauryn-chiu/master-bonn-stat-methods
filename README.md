- The version that we're going to submit will be **always** in the "Final" folder.
- If you want to make **BIG** changes or work in a specific problem create a "YourName_Version#_Stat_P0#.ipynb" inside the problem folder "Ex.#".
- If you're sure of your results, plots or analysis just update/push the file in the "Final" folder.
- We can add comments on everyone notebook, but add your *Name* to the comment :).
