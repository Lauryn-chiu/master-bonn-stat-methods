IMPORTANT info to remember:
- The version that we're going to deliver will be always in the "Final" folder.
- If you want to make BIG changes or work in a specific problem make "NameVersion_Stat_P0#.ipynb" inside the related problem folder.
- If you're sure of the results, plots or analysis just update/push the "MAIN_Version" file.
